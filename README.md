Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We only provide a sample code that demonstrates how the product works as described.

## Code Description

The provided code consists of an expert advisor for MetaTrader 5 that contains several functions to determine trend direction and execute trades. Here is a breakdown of the code structure:

### Include necessary libraries

The code includes the necessary libraries for trading and working with date and time.

### Define global variables

- `CTrade trade`: An instance of the `CTrade` class for executing trading operations.
- `int totalTrades`: The total number of trades executed by the expert advisor.
- `double accountBalance`: The current account balance.
- `double capitalPart`: The calculated part of the account balance to be used for trading.

### Initialization function (OnInit)

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. It sets the trading volume within recommended limits.

### Start function (OnStart)

The `OnStart` function is called when the expert advisor starts trading. It implements innovative methods to determine the trend direction and executes trades accordingly. If an uptrend is detected, a buy position is opened. If a downtrend is detected, a sell position is opened. If no trend is detected, all positions are closed.

### Trend determination functions (IsUptrend and IsDowntrend)

The `IsUptrend` and `IsDowntrend` functions are used to determine if there is an uptrend or a downtrend, respectively. These functions currently return a static value, but they can be modified to include actual trend determination logic.

### Position opening functions (Buy and Sell)

The `Buy` and `Sell` functions are used to open buy and sell positions, respectively. They calculate the lot size based on the capital part and execute the corresponding trading operation.

### Position closing function (CloseAllPositions)

The `CloseAllPositions` function is used to close all open positions. It calls the `PositionCloseAll` function of the `CTrade` class and resets the total trades count.

### Deinitialization function (OnDeinit)

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the expert advisor is about to be removed. It checks if there are any open positions and closes them before the expert advisor is closed.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and does not include complete functionality or error handling. It is intended to demonstrate the basic structure and logic of the expert advisor.
